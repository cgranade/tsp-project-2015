    "1. Using QuTiP's ``rand_ket`` function to generate examples, show that these two likelihood functions agree for $E = \\left|\\phi\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle\\phi\\right|$. Write a function that raises an error if the two likelihoods disagree.\n",
    "2. What is the probability of measuring $\\left|0\\right\\rangle\\left\\langle0\\right|$ for the mixed state $\\rho = \\mathbb{1} / 2$? Explain why this agrees with what you know from the likelihood function for pure states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** In QuTiP 3.1.0, ``rand_ket`` samples states in an ad-hoc manner; we'll later see a more formal way to do this known as the Haar distribution. Support for Haar-random states and unitaries has been added to QuTiP 3.2.0, which should come out some time soon. If you're already using QuTiP 3.2 or later, please feel free to use ``rand_ket_haar`` instead."
